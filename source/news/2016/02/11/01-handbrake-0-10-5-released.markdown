HandBrake 0.10.5 Released
=========================

Unfortunately due to circumstances beyond our control we can no longer include binary distributions of HandBrake which include the FDK-AAC encoder.

Please also be aware that if you are distributing any previous 0.10.x you must cease doing so now due to licensing issues.

## Release Highlights

- Removal of FDK AAC from our binary releases.
  - Please see our [AAC Encoder Change Announcement](https://forum.handbrake.fr/viewtopic.php?f=33&t=34143) to understand what this means.
- Updated x265 to 1.9 which brings bug fixes and performance improvements.
- Few minor bug fixes since the 0.10.3 release. This includes improvements in large AVI file handling.

We would also like to again remind everyone that handbrake.fr is the only official place to download HandBrake. If you do download it from another website, we highly recommend that you verify your download against the SHA1 checksums provided via the download page.

If you happen to discover any bugs or issues please tell us about them in the [bugs forum](https://forum.handbrake.fr/viewforum.php?f=12) or the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/HandBrake/HandBrake/issues). You can also let us know [via our IRC channels](http://handbrake.fr/community.php).
